                     Almost half of respondents were using or had used 3 or more storage apps, which came up time and again in the complaints.<br>
                     Top complaints: 1. Not enough free space (44% of complaints); 2. Multiple services &amp; logins confusion (22%) and

                     of the buttons with “sync.” Those were words employed by users themselves when guessing what the buttons did and as they
                     paraphrased explanations I had just given them.  I removed the app button since it was clear that users were able to easily access

                  said the interface was easy to understand and reminded them of Google Drive.<br>
                  The improvements that I needed to make to the design were identified during the users’ narration phase of the usability tests.

                           account, similar to how G Drive is at the click of a button within Gmail, something users loved per surveys.
                           However, I realized users were tripping up on this page. As I studied the page setup and asked follow-up questions,
                           I realized that A) this page diverged too much from the industry norm B) it wasn’t useful for the login page, as opposed
                           to the activating account page, and C) having an extra click to log in with a non-Gmail, non-Outlook, or non-Facebook account
                           was punishing those users unintentionally. Hence why I replaced the ‘other’ button with the email and password input fields.

                  were able to correctly guess what the buttons did, and accomplished
                  the other tested tasks easily, so the app is on the right track, and I
