                  <p>I expected that people would be familiar with cloud storage, but I was surprised to learn how oversaturated respondents felt with the number of services they use.
                     Almost half of respondents were using or had used 3 or more storage apps, which came up time and again in the complaints.<br>
                     Top complaints: 1. Not enough free space (44% of complaints); 2. Multiple services &amp; logins confusion (22%) and
                     2. Sharing files with non users (22%); 3. Conerns over who has file permissions (11%).

                  <p>Respondents indicated that all the features we asked about were important to them. However, they ranked uploading files as the most important
                     feature and saving content online as the least important. Outside of these rankings, respondents also expressed that they collaborate on a
                     daily basis via their chosen service, so that was clearly important as well.

                     service to another, the most common responses were: 1.  User-friendly UI (35%), 2. Multi-device platform (26%), and
                     3. Wide variety of native programs (22%) tied with 3. Being built on an email platform with an already wide user base (22%).

               <h3>sketches</h3>
               <p>While sketching, I went through multiple iterations of several pages such as the user dashboard here. It became clear the user
                  dashboard didn’t need a nav menu, which led to the second image. However, in the last iteration I included buttons for common
                  tasks that people have struggled with per user surveys and a couple of tasks that differentiate DeskSpace from its competitors like an “organize” button.

               <p>In bringing the sketches to life on the screen, I was able to flesh out the proportions between buttons, menus, icons etc.
                  I also got clearer ideas of how graphics and terminology would communicate the intended, concise user flows to new users as
                  I connected pages and symbols in the prototype.

               </div>
               <p>Users felt comfortable navigating most of the site, but as users narrated their experience, I observed there was confusion over
                  the new features - especially regarding the organize/import button - so I updated the terminology to “clean up” and replaced one
                  of the buttons with “sync.” Those were words employed by users themselves when guessing what the buttons did and as they
                  paraphrased explanations I had just given them.  I removed the app button since it was clear that users were able to easily access
                  the integrated apps through the ‘new’ button and the sidebar.

                  I asked new users to narrate their experiences and perform the same three tasks as before, plus one a new one that involved the
                  ‘new feature’: deleting duplicates. The users were able to perform all four tasks, this time with even less hesitation. They
                  said the interface was easy to understand and reminded them of Google Drive.<br>
                  The improvements that I needed to make to the design were identified during the users’ narration phase of the usability tests.

                        <p>I strongly recommended signing up with an email because my intent was to have the product available directly within an email
                           account, similar to how G Drive is at the click of a button within Gmail, something users loved per surveys.
                           However, I realized users were tripping up on this page. As I studied the page setup and asked follow-up questions,
                           I realized that A) this page diverged too much from the industry norm B) it wasn’t useful for the login page, as opposed
                           to the activating account page, and C) having an extra click to log in with a non-Gmail, non-Outlook, or non-Facebook account
                           was punishing those users unintentionally. Hence why I replaced the ‘other’ button with the email and password input fields.

                           two extra buttons for them. Instead, those users could use the “other” button. Plus, Facebook’s button was oddly placed and
                           strange in proportion to the others.
