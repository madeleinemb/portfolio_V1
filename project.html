          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>A company wants to get into the cloud storage industry - what do consumers already get from their cloud storage options,
            what users should they target, what do those users wish they had, how can you build it, and what type of brand should deliver it?</p>
        </section>

        <section id="solution">
          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>DeskSpace is a customizable cloud storage and content creation service for consumers straddling too many cloud services. In addition
            to all the Google Drive and Dropbox features, DeskSpace allows users to reduce file bloat across multiple services to get more
            ‘desk space’ without forcing local downloads or having to temporarily pay for more space.</p>

              <h4 class = "ds-mini-section-header">Oversaturation & Complaints<h4>
              <p>I expected that people would be familiar with cloud storage, but I was surprised to learn how oversaturated respondents felt with the number of services they use.
                Almost half of respondents were using or had used 3 or more storage apps, which came up time and again in the complaints.<br>
                Top complaints: 1. Not enough free space (44% of complaints); 2. Multiple services & logins confusion (22%) and
                2. Sharing files with non users (22%); 3. Conerns over who has file permissions (11%).
              </p>

              <div class = "analysis-section">
                <h5 class = "answers-section">Why do respondents use so many services?</h5>
                <p>1) people will jump to other services in order to get more free space<br>
                   2) interacting with users of other services or non-users sometimes necessitates multiple sign ups<br>
                   3) certain devices are set up by default with certain cloud services (e.g. iPhones & iCloud)<br>

              <img id="features" src="assets/images/Features Graph.png" alt="Features Graph">
              <p>Respondents indicated that all the features we asked about were important to them. However, they ranked uploading files as the most important
                feature and saving content online as the least important. Outside of these rankings, respondents also expressed that they collaborate on a
                daily basis via their chosen service, so that was clearly important as well.
              </p>
              <img id="g-drive" src="assets/images/G Drive Info.png" alt="G Drive Preferred">
              <img id="devices" src="assets/images/Survey Device.png" alt="Devices Preference">
              <p>70% of respondents stated that they prefered G Drive to other options. Upon looking at the open responses as to why users preferred one
                service to another, the most common responses were: 1.  User-friendly UI (35%), 2. Multi-device platform (26%), and
                3. Wide variety of native programs (22%) tied with 3. Being built on an email platform with an already wide user base (22%).
