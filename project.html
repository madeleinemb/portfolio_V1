However, I realized users were tripping up on this page. As I studied the page setup and asked follow-up questions, I realized that A) this page diverged too much from the industry norm B) it wasn’t useful for the login page, as opposed to the activating account page, and C) having an extra click to log in with a non-Gmail, non-Outlook, or non-Facebook account was punishing those users unintentionally. Hence why I replaced the ‘other’ button with the email & password input fields.

                <p class = "left"><strong class = "conc">It wasn’t surprising</strong> that users want as much free space as they can get and want files to upload and download as fast as possible;
                   however, it was surprising that in trying to solve those issues on their own, users created new issues like having too many
                   forgettable, disorganized accounts and getting confused on who had access to what.
                </p>

                 <p class = "left">At first, I considered free space and upload times purely technical
                    issues. My breakthrough was realizing I could use design to alleviate
                    the “free space” issue by helping users make the most of the space
                    they have. Not only did it address the number one problem among users,
                    but it also fit perfectly with the needs of our second user persona,
                    Jenna, who wants her things organized.
                 </p>

                 <p class = "right">If given more time, I would create more examples of what onboarding
                    messaging should look like for first-time users so that during
                    usability tests, I would hear more certainty from respondents about
                    what the buttons like “clean up” and “sync” did. As it is, the users
                    were able to correctly guess what the buttons did, and accomplished
                    the other tested tasks easily, so the app is on the right track, and I
                    look forward to seeing its successful evolution.
