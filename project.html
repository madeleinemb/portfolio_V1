                <h2 class="ds-category-heading">Conclusion</h2>

                <p><strong class = "conc">It wasn’t surprising</strong> that users want as much free space as they can get and want files to upload
                  and download as fast as possible; however, it was surprising that in trying to solve those issues on their own, users
                  created new issues like having too many forgettable, disorganized accounts and getting confused on who had access to what.
                </p>

                <p>At first, I considered free space and upload times purely technical
                   issues. My breakthrough was realizing I could use design to alleviate
                   the “free space” issue by helping users make the most of the space
                   they have. Not only did it address the number one problem among users,
                   but it also fit perfectly with the needs of our second user persona,
                   Jenna, who wants her things organized.
                </p>

                <div  class="quote">
                   <p id = "conclusion-quote"><img class = "quote-sym" src = "assets/images/open_quotes_blue.png" alt = "quotes">[I realized] I could use design to alleviate the 'free space' issue by helping users make the most of the

                 <p>If given more time, I would create more examples of what onboarding
                    messaging should look like for first-time users so that during
                    usability tests, I would hear more certainty from respondents about
                    what the buttons like “clean up” and “sync” did. As it is, the users
                    were able to correctly guess what the buttons did, and accomplished
                    the other tested tasks easily, so the app is on the right track, and I
                    look forward to seeing its successful evolution.
