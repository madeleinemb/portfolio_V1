            <p><strong>I've always loved</strong> art! As a kid driving back and forth all the time across Texas - which, if it were a country, would rank as the 39th largest in the world! *humming the ‘more you know’ song* -
              my Magna Doodle kept me sane. As I grew up, the Magna Doodle was replaced by oil on canvas, but I loved it just as much.
              Still, in an Italian-Irish working class family, art was something you did for fun,
              so I never contemplated it as a career. Luckily, this worked out in my favor… eventually.
              By the time I set my sights on UX Design, I got to roll more than just my love of art into a career. <img id = "magna-doodle" class = "image-square" src = "assets/images/magnadoodle_small.png">I had finally found a profession that could utilize my other interests too: a fascination with
              psychology, a love of learning and teaching languages, utilizing technology, and a pursuit of efficiency.<br><br>

            <p>My mom claims she never once had to ask me to do my homework because I was so self-motivated. My test scores earned me
              financial aid to attend a swanky high school where I met friends with whom I’m still close, but academically I became
              focused on being the best at everything as opposed to finding the thing I wanted to be the best at. In college, I loved
              my psychology classes and assisted in an evolutionary biology psych lab, but my family dissuaded me from either a
              psychology or art degree. I don’t regret it, because this led me to Teach for America.<br><br>
              My Public Relations degree taught me how to write and for that I will always be grateful because it was a hard-won
              lesson and it has proved important in every profession. However, my PR internships and informational interviews failed
              to inspire me. Luckily, in came a Teach for America recruiter, which changed my life.<br><br>

            <div class = "blue-bg horizontal divider mobile-only"></div>

            <p>In Teach for America (TFA), a two-year AmeriCorps program, I learned I could survive anything including being a teacher
              on the first day of preK, which often resembles a war zone (no really, this is only a slight exaggeration), all while
              speaking my second language. I had never been around kids so small, let alone been in charge of 22 lives, and that
              first week was the most challenging week of my life. At each new job, I’ve maintained calm under pressure and there’s no
              doubt it’s in large part due to the resilience I learned here. And, yes, I grew to love those little people!<br><br>

              The second thing I learned was how to ‘backwards plan,’ which was how I wrote an entire curriculum and maintained high
              standards for my students when the district lacked resources. Backwards planning is setting goals, working backward to
              create smaller goals and tasks that will lead to the main goals, and measuring students’ progress to make adjustments
              along the way. This technique is key to any project, and aligns to my work now as a designer in user stories, acceptance
              criteria, and the iterative process.<br><br>

              Finally, TFA stressed the “eternal student” mindset, or “growth mindset,” and cemented this lesson in monthly learning
              seminars where I was surrounded by some of the brightest people I’ve ever met while we learned about new technology and
              research and received constructive criticism. Seeing new ways to work smarter and not harder and the message that you can
              learn and adapt at any age is something I took with me that I think about daily as a designer.<br><br>
            </p>

            <div class = "blue-bg divider mobile-only"></div>

            <p>I decided after TFA to take a big swing (making up for my pragmatic college approach) and I moved out of state for the
              first time. I arrived in Los Angeles, hoping to produce shows like those that had inspired me as I grew up; shows with
              strong female leads like “Veronica Mars,” “30 Rock,” and “Parks and Rec.” Despite people telling me it was impossible
              with my lack of entertainment experience, I managed to get a gig as a production assistant and worked my  way up to TV
              Development, which is when I had the epiphany that I was more fulfilled during the day creating Google Sheets hacks,
              researching trends, and creating assets in Photoshop than I was reading TV scripts. Again, my brain was steering back
              towards design and tech. This time, I took the hint.<br><br>

            <div class = "conclusion">
              <p>I told my friend that evening about my epiphany, and lamented that I didn’t know of any jobs where I could use such a
                road, yet specific set of skills like design, technology, research, and interpersonal communication. I thank my lucky
                stars that my friend happened to have just caught up with a college friend who had earned her masters in Human-Computer
                Interaction at Carnegie Mellon. I scheduled my first informational interview with her, then met and discussed UX with her
                contacts in LA, and enrolled in my first UX class. I haven’t looked back since.
